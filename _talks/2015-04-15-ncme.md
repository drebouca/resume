_This study employs a two-step procedure which selects an anchor set and assesses the items outside the anchor for DIF (M-IT/M-PA; Wang & Shih, 2010). Results show that accuracy rates in selecting an anchor with multiple imputation were generally higher than with full-information maximum likelihood._

When data is MCAR, DIF detection yields high power even with 30% of missing, large sample size and moderate DIF effect. Under MAR and MNAR, however, DIF detection was affected when sample size was small and DIF effect was moderate.
