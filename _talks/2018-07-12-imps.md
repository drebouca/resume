Using DIF effect size measures along with a DIF assessment method has been shown to reduce inflated type I error rates (Hidalgo, GÃ³mez-Benito & Zumbo, 2014). Some commonly used effect size measures are: 
- _log-odds based_: the Delta scale in the Mantel-Haenszel method (Holland & Thayer, 1988),
- _variance based_: the Delta R squared in the logistic regression approach (Zumbo & Thomas, 1997),
- _or probablity based_: the difference in item difficulty parameters between groups in an IRT framework (e.g. Finch, 2005; Woods, 2009; Wang & Shih, 2010). 

Currently, there are equivalence between these types of effect size measures (DeMars, 2011). Effect size and power may also depend on the item discrimination and difficulty. 

Furthermore, there is _no universal interpretation of power_ in DIF studies, since it is associated with the DIF effect size, among other variables.

In this study we show that the lack of universal DIF effect size measure makes interpretation of power of DIF detection difficult, and we investigate the relationship between the DIF effect size measure and the selection of an anchor set for DIF detection.
