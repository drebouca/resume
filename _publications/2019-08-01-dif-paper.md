The ability to detect differential item functioning (DIF) depends on many factors, including
__sample size__ of each demographic group, average true latent trait scores in each group, the
chosen DIF assessment method, the magnitude of DIF effect and the quality of the anchor set.

In this two-part study, we show rates of identifying DIF items are higher when the anchor set is made up of highly discriminating items. We also show that DIF items are more easily detected if they have high discrimination and at least moderate difficulty (if using a correctly specified anchor).
